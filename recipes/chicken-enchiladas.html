        <p>These cheesy chicken enchiladas are a must and bursting with flavor</p>
        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <p>Makes 4 to 6 servings</p>
        <ul>
            <li>9 tomatillos, husked and rinsed</li>
            <li>1/2 medium white onion</li>
            <li>1 serrano chile</li>
            <li>1 yellow chile (guero)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves, loosely packed</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>6 (6-inch) corn tortillas</li>
            <li>2 store-bought rotisserie chicken breasts, skinned and shredded (to yield 1 1/2 cups)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Mexican crema or sour cream</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>PREPARATION</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Put the tomatillos, onion, serrano, yellow chile and 3/4 cup water in a medium, heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover and boil until the tomatillos turn olive-green color, about 10 minutes. Transfer the tomatillos, onion and chiles to a blender. Add the garlic and cilantro and blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the tortillas until golden but still pliable, about 10 seconds per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain.</li>
            <li>Put the tortillas on a work surface. Divide the shredded chicken evenly among the tortillas and roll up each like a cigar. Spread 1/3 cup sauce in a 9 by 13-inch glass baking dish. Arrange the enchiladas, seam-side down, in one layer snugly inside the dish. Pour the remaining sauce over the enchiladas.</li>
            <li>Drizzle with the Mexican crema and sprinkle the cheese all over. Bake until the cheese melts and starts to brown in spots, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
