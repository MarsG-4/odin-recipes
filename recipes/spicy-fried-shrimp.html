        <h4>For the Shrimp:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/4 pounds small shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>Bibb lettuce leaves, for serving</li>
            <li>Thinly sliced scallions, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>PREPARATION</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the sauce: Mix the mayonnaise, chili sauce, honey, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon water in a large bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare the shrimp: Heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Meanwhile, whisk the eggs in a shallow bowl. Whisk the flour, cornstarch and 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper in another shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, dredge the shrimp in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess, dip in the beaten eggs, then return to the flour mixture, turning to form a thick crust. Fry the shrimp in the hot oil until lightly golden, 1 to 2 minutes, adjusting the heat as needed to maintain the oil temperature. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate with a slotted spoon.</li>
            <li>Toss the shrimp with the prepared sauce. Arrange the lettuce in a shallow serving bowl or on individual plates. Top with the shrimp and garnish with scallions.</li>
        </ol>
